## Description

Issue: https://github.com/Software-Engineering-Red/MAUI-APP/issues/77

I had to implement staff rotas. The rotas needed to be associated with a location and be eligible only to specific team members. Eligible members can be assigned for a specific amount of time. A calender of rotas needed to be available.

This issue is a lot more complicated than previous issues, so unfortunately I was no able to finish it this week.

There were some issues with the ticket I reviewed. The data needed was hardcoded in the Experts class and did not use the database. Some better encapsulation was also needed. 

## Reflection

The ticket I am working on now is quite a bit more complicated than previous ones, requiring a wide range of functionality. My MAUI knowledge is lacking for me to be able to implement it in a week. Another issue is that the application is structured in a way that makes it hard to interface with the other tables, thus making relying on JOINs and foreign keys hard.
