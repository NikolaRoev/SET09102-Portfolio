# Project work 5

## Description

Issue: https://github.com/Software-Engineering-Red/MAUI-APP/issues/77
PR: https://github.com/Software-Engineering-Red/MAUI-APP/pull/142

Updated the data to the new AModel used, but the application appears to be broken.

## Reviews

PR: https://github.com/Software-Engineering-Red/MAUI-APP/pull/184

All the changes worked correctly and there was nothing major to be changed. Only thing missing was some more comments due to the more involved logic needed for the ticket. This was before the newest major rewrite.

## Reflection

- Not having someone in charge, again, appears to be a detriment to the project.
- There are way too many layers of abstraction over a simple CRUD application, making any contribution hard.
- I tried to just add snippets of code that would theoretically work.
