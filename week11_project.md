# Project work 4

## Description

Issue: https://github.com/Software-Engineering-Red/MAUI-APP/issues/77
PR: https://github.com/Software-Engineering-Red/MAUI-APP/pull/142

I modified the Rota object to now have a location and validity. I also added a Rota pool object that will be used to make the table that will hold the information of which team member is assignable to which rota and if assigned for how long.

## Reviews

PR: https://github.com/Software-Engineering-Red/MAUI-APP/pull/144

There was not anything significant that needed to be changed for the review I did this week. There were some hard-coded values that could be moved to a resource file. There was also a method that was not yet implemented, but it was not critical for the needed functionality and could be added at a later time.

## Reflection

- Adding new functionality to a project that is not structured correctly is hard.
- Restructuring a project is quite complicated.
- I've started practising a more iterative approach when building software. It helps me better understand the technologies I am using and it improves my design process.
